# XEDI Tech Test

This test is designed to provide us with an understanding of your level as a developer.

This test should take around 2 - 3 hours once you have your environment set up.

### The Test

Using the [Laravel PHP framework](http://laravel.com), create a basic Todo application which satisfies the following user stories.

- As a User, I can sign up for a User account, so that I can access the application.
- As a User, I can login to my account.
- As a User, I can logout of my account.
- As a User, I can create a `TodoList`.
- As a User, I can view a list of my `TodoList`s.
- As a User, I can rename my `TodoList`s.
- As a User, I can delete a `TodoList`.
- As a User, I can add a `Todo` item to a `TodoList`.
- As a User, I can see all the `Todo` items on my `TodoList`.
- As a User, I can delete `Todo` items from a `TodoList`.
- As a User, I can mark `Todo` items as completed.

It is important that you demonstrate an understanding of VCS during this test. Git is favourable. The use of services such as GitHub, Gitlab or BitBucket is not required. A local git repository is sufficient for this demonstration.

Use as much of the framework as possible.

#### Quick Start

If you don't have an development environment for Laravel already, consider using the [Bitnami Laravel Development Container](https://hub.docker.com/r/bitnami/laravel/).

```shell
$ curl -LO https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bitnami/bitnami-docker-laravel/master/docker-compose.yml
$ docker-compose up -d && docker-compose logs -f
```

#### Submission

Please send your completed test to [`careers@xedi.com`](mailto:careers@xedi.com) either as a ZIP archive or as a link to a online repository. **Your submission must include your git history.**

#### Marking Guidance

In this test the following shall be considered:

* Use of VCS - As evidenced by git history
* Coding to Standards (PSR-2)
* Use of Tests
* Solution Design
* Solution Implementation
* Adherance to User Stories

All tests must run successfully or be annotated correctly (i.e. `@incomplete`).

Feel free to add a document in the root of the repository stating any assumptions, justifications and ideas for further development.
